This chapter consists of a copy of the recent publication by the MicroBooNE collaboration primarily authored by the thesis author which discusses in detail the algorithm used to compute the momentum of tracks in a LArTPC by means of multiple Coulomb scattering. This is a crucial part of the previously described kaon production measurement, which in turn is a crucial part of constraining the sizable intrinsic $\nu_e$ from kaon decay background in the electron-like low energy excess search.
